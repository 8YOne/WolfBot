// TODO take a coin that has USD and BTC trading pair. for example XRP
// 1. compute the price: XRP/USD / BTC/USD -> USD gets out and we get a computed XRP/BTC price
// 2. trade the XRP/BTC under the assumption that this price will follow the computed price
// might work better if the computed price is on a high volume exchange and the actual rate on a low volume exchange

// TODO add API to allow following multiple pairs and compute rates
